        <p className='paragraph'>
        I learned the fundamentals of how physiological signals 
        from the human body are measured and analyzed. I studied the physiological systems, 
        the basics of biometrics, and the concept of the Man-Instrument system, including its 
        components and the common problems encountered when measuring signals in a living system. 
        I also explored the concept of intelligent medical instrumentation and gained a solid 
        understanding of bioelectric phenomena like resting and action potentials, how action 
        potentials propagate, and how models like the Nernst equation, Goldman equation, 
        and the Hodgkin-Huxley model help explain these processes.
        I learned about the sources of bioelectric potentials and how signals are captured 
        using electrodes, including the differences between polarizable and non-polarizable 
        electrodes, and the issues that arise at the electrode-electrolyte interface 
        and the electrode-skin interface, such as motion artifacts. Through experiments, 
        I studied the block diagram of the man-instrument system and worked with various 
        biopotential electrodes like surface electrodes, needle electrodes, microelectrodes, 
        pH, pO₂, pCO₂ electrodes, transcutaneous electrodes, and ion-sensitive field-effect 
        transistors (ISFETs). This unit gave me a strong foundation in bioinstrumentation 
        and how it connects engineering with human physiology

        <p>
        I explored how bio-signals are acquired from various 
        physiological systems, with a focus on the cardiovascular and nervous systems. 
        I began by studying the basic anatomy and physiology of the heart, its electrophysiology, 
        and the characteristics of the ECG waveform, including the 12-lead ECG configuration and 
        the working of an ECG machine. I also learned about different types of arrhythmias and 
        how they appear in ECG signals, as well as long-term monitoring methods like Holter recording.

       I then studied the anatomy and function of the brain, the origin of bioelectric potentials in 
       the brain, and how these are measured using the 10-20 electrode placement system in EEG recordings.
       I examined the block diagram of an EEG machine and how computerized systems are used to analyze 
       EEG signals. I also got introduced to Magnetoencephalography (MEG).

      In addition, I learned the basics of Electromyography (EMG) and how EMG signals are recorded 
      from muscles, as well as how to measure Electrooculography (EOG) signals, which originate 
      from eye movements, and Electroretinography (ERG) signals from the retina. I also covered 
      Phonocardiography (PCG) for recording heart sounds, and understood the sources of signal 
      artifacts and their impact on measurement accuracy. The unit concluded with an introduction 
      to biofeedback instrumentation.

      Through experiments, I gained practical experience with real-time monitoring of ECG, EEG, and 
      EMG, which helped me understand how these signals are captured, processed, and interpreted in 
      clinical and research settings.

    <div className="collapse-title font-semibold">Unit 3: Blood Pressure and Blood Flow Measurement</div>
    <div className="collapse-content text-sm">
        <p>
        I focused on the measurement of blood pressure, blood flow, cardiac output, and blood 
        oxygenation using various biomedical techniques. I started by learning about indirect 
        methods of measuring blood pressure, such as the auscultatory method using a sphygmomanometer, 
        and moved on to direct methods, which involve inserting a catheter into an artery to obtain 
        continuous pressure readings.

        I explored multiple blood flow measurement techniques, including the electromagnetic 
        blood flow meter, ultrasonic flow meter, NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) flow meter, 
        and the laser Doppler flow meter, each based on different physical principles for assessing 
        the volume and velocity of blood. I then studied cardiac output measurement using several 
        approaches such as the dye dilution method, thermal dilution method, and more advanced 
        techniques like aortic pressure waveform analysis, impedance cardiography, ultrasound, 
        bioreactance, and the CO₂ rebreathing method.

        Next, I learned how to measure heart rate and understand its relationship with cardiovascular 
        function. I also covered both in vitro and in vivo oximetry techniques to monitor oxygen 
        saturation in blood. Devices studied included the ear oximeter, pulse oximeter, skin reflectance 
        oximeter, and intravascular oximeter, each offering unique advantages in clinical monitoring.

        Through hands-on experiments, I practiced the measurement of blood flow, cardiac output, and 
        studied different types of oximeters, which helped me understand how physiological parameters 
        are measured in both clinical and laboratory settings, and the importance of accurate, real-time 
        monitoring in patient care.

    <div className="collapse-content text-sm">
        <p>
        I studied various measurement techniques used in the respiratory system, beginning with an 
        introduction to the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system, including how gas exchange 
        and distribution occur in the lungs. I learned how to measure respiratory volumes and capacities 
        using spirometry, which provides valuable information about lung function.

        I explored different types of pneumotachometers, which are devices that measure airflow during 
        breathing, and how they help in assessing pulmonary performance. I also studied various 
        respiratory gas analyzers, including the infrared gas analyzer for detecting CO₂, oxygen 
        analyzers, thermal conductivity analyzers, and nitrogen gas analyzers, which are used to 
        evaluate the concentration of respiratory gases in clinical and research settings.

       To measure the respiration rate, I learned about several methods such as the displacement 
       method, thermistor method, impedance pneumography, and the CO₂ detection method. 
       I also understood how apnea detectors work to identify the absence of breathing. 
       Finally, I studied how respiratory parameters are monitored in real-time using bedside 
       and central monitoring systems, which are critical in intensive care and surgical environments.

       In the experimental part of this unit, I conducted pulmonary analysis using a spirometer, 
       studied different types of pneumotachometers, and performed respiration rate measurements, 
       giving me practical insights into how respiratory functions are measured and monitored in 
       healthcare.

    <div className="collapse-content text-sm">
        <p>
        I focused on biomedical instruments used for therapy and ensuring patient safety, particularly 
        in cardiac care. I started by understanding the need for cardiac pacemakers, their role in 
        maintaining heart rhythm, and the differences between external and implantable pacemakers. 
        I also explored the latest advancements in implantable pacemakers, including features like 
        rate responsiveness and wireless programming, and studied how a pacing system analyzer is used 
        to evaluate pacemaker function.

        I then learned about DC defibrillators, which are used to restore normal heart rhythm during 
        cardiac emergencies, along with different types of implantable defibrillators and pacer 
        cardioverter-defibrillators (PCDs) that combine pacing and defibrillation functions. 
        I also studied defibrillator analyzers, which ensure that these life-saving devices are 
        functioning correctly. Additionally, I explored the working of Left Ventricular Assist Devices 
        (LVADs) used in patients with severe heart failure.

        A significant part of this unit was focused on electrical safety. I learned about electric 
        shock hazards, including microshock and macroshock, the threshold of perception, and the risks 
        of leakage currents in clinical settings. I studied safety codes and standards for electromedical 
        equipment to ensure patient and operator protection. I also learned how to use an electrical 
        safety analyzer for testing biomedical equipment and ensuring compliance with safety regulations.

        Through hands-on experiments, I examined the functioning of pacemakers and defibrillators, 
        studied safety codes, and participated in a model exam lab, which helped me apply theoretical 
        knowledge to practical scenarios involving therapeutic devices and patient safety systems.
